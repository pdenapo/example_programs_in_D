An example of a web application using vide-d, mustache-d and bootrap.

This application is based on the example incumpled with vibe-d in the directory
/examples.

The included files from bootstrap are from

for details on the original bootstrap licence.

[Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/) is a template engine.

Vibe-d uses its own "diet templates" by default, but I don't like them
since they do not keep the usual html syntax as Mustache does.
