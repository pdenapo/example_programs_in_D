# Example Programs in D

D is my favourite programming language. It is compiled to native machine code, static typed and with the 
over-all C look and feel. But it offers many high level facilities like python.

Even though there are many (third-party) librearies in D for doing almost anything that you may want, usually they
are not well documented.

So I keep here some examples for myself of how I managed to do some things, and I believe that these examples could be also useful to others.

## Interfaces with order languages

* call_D_library_from_bun: How to call a D library form the Bun (javascript).
* use_lua: execute lua code form D.

## Databases

- using_sqlite

## Testing

- test_silly
