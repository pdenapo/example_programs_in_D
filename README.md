# example_programs_in_D

D is my favourite programming languages. It is compiled to native machine code, static typed and with the 
over-all C look and feel. But it offers many high level facilities like python.

Even though there are many (third-party) librearies in D for doing almost anything that you may want, usually they
are not well documented.

So I keep here some examples for myself of how I managed to do some things, and I believe the these examples could be also useful to others.
